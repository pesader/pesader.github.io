summary: A simple environment manager for toolbx
---

Toolenv allows you to easily setup custom environment variables and shell configurations depending on the [toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/) you are in. This is useful for setting up developer environments, as well as shell tools that require a script to be ran on the user's shell (e.g. direnv, zoxide, fzf, etc).
