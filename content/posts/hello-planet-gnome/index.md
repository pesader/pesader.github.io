Hi, everyone!

I’m Pedro Sader Azevedo, a Computer Engineering student at Universidade
Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil. In the next few months I’ll be
working as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) intern to integrate the functionality
of GNOME Network Displays into GNOME Settings, with the guidance of Felipe
Borges, Claudio Wunder, Jonas Ådahl, and Anupam Kumar.

# More about me

During the pandemic, when every aspect of life was moved to the digital realm,
I learned about Free Software and was won over by its principled stance on
technology. I decided to take back my computing and became a user (and vocal
advocate) of GNU/Linux!

Soon after, I helped organize The Week of Computing at my university. I invited
a representative of GNOME (the one and only Georges Stavracas!), whose talk was
especially impressive to me as I thoroughly identified with the values of
freedom, collaboration, and inclusivity embodied by the project.

I started contributing with translations (which I still do a lot!) and was so
warmly welcomed that I soon started programming as well. I also contribute with
community-engagement, by helping the Free and Open Source Software study group
[LKCAMP](https://lkcamp.dev/about/) organize events that promote usage of and
contribution to FOSS projects.

# More about my internship

The goal of the internship is to the add networks displays (i.e. "screen
casting") to GNOME Settigs. I plan to do that by separating the backend of
GNOME Network Displays into a library, then using that library to implement
the new feature on the settings app.

This change will contribute to the general impression of using a “first-class”
operating system that seamlessly integrates with others. While it is true that
the app already provides said feature, finding it directly in Settings is much
more reassuring and convenient than having to install a separate program just
for that.
